# Financial Data Quality Assessment and Summarization Tool for SEC PDFs and Freddie Mac Datasets

### Project Description:
This project involves building a Streamlit-based tool that serves two primary purposes:

## Part 1: PDF Analyzer

- Allows users to input a link to a PDF document from the SEC website.
- Provides the option to choose between the "nougat" and "pypdf" libraries for PDF processing.
- The two data sources (PDF files) are connected directly to the "streamlit" component.
- From "streamlit," the data flows to two different custom components: "Nougat" and "PyPdf."
- Both "Nougat" and "PyPdf" components feed their processed data to a custom component called "Spacy." 

## Part 2: Data Quality Evaluation Tool 

- Data from the "Freddie Mac Origination File" and "Freddi Mac Monthly Performance File" is directed to the "Pandas Profiling" component for data processing.
- Enables users to upload CSV/XLS files containing either Origination or Monthly performance data from the Freddie Mac Single Family Dataset.
- Pandas Profiling is performed generate data summaries and displays them to the end user.
- Great Expectations tests are executed to ensure that the data adheres to the schema published by Freddie Mac by performing validations. This validation process ensures that the 
  data meets the specified criteria and quality standards.
- Additionally, the data is stored in Amazon S3 for storage purposes and is continuously monitored and tracked using "Amazon Cloud Watch" to ensure system performance and data 
  integrity.
